 Whether we choose to recognize it, standards are something we carry around and utilize in our daily lives. There are certain standards that must be met for the food we consume or the way we hold conversations. One can assume that the person reading this essay has a certain standard for which the essay must be written. Standards such as the convention, the grammar, general attraction, so on, so forth. These same standards also carry over to the way one codes.

Speaking of coding standards, the general standards pertain to the code structure and syntax, particularly when it comes to variable initializations or object orientation. After using ESLint, a JavaScript code inspector, for a week, it has been quite “annoying”. “Annoying” in the sense that there were many syntactical errors with my code, and it would constantly remind me of my mistakes. However, due to such annoyances, ESLint has shown me how JavaScript is expected to be structured and the similarities between these coding standards compared to the other standards I was taught. In both coding standards, the indentation remained consistent, along with proper spacing, and the ensurement of variable / function use. Through noticing these similarities, it had also occurred to me that by keeping such coding standards consistent, the learning of new coding languages became quite easier.

Standards are really important, especially when it comes to the work and products we produce. Coding standards are certainly not an exemption to this rule. Through abiding these standards, learning new languages will be quicker and the code produced will come across as high quality. Having no standards is impossible as that is a standard within itself. So might as well just abide by the high standards we set for ourselves.
