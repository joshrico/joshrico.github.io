Because the technology stack for this class is designed for the creation of web applications, some students think this class is simply about web application development. Of course, web application development is a skill youâ€™ve acquired in this class, but the more fundamental goal of this class is for you to acquire experience with fundamental software engineering concepts including:

- Open Source Software Development
- Configuration Management
- Development Environments
- Coding Standards
- Agile Project Management

Reflect on what you learned about software engineering in general during this course, by taking two or three of these topics and discussing what they mean beyond web application development. For example, you learned about a style of Agile Project Management called Issue Driven Project Management. Could you see yourself using that project management style for a project not involving web applications? If so, then discuss what Agile Project Management is, what Issue Driven Project Management is, and how you could see yourself applying it to different project contexts.


"Software Engineering is just another class I need for my Bachelor's Degree" or so I thought. Just like any other student, I have been going through the motions in attempts to earn my degree. And of course, I held the same point of view heading into Software Engineering. However, I was not expecting to learn the amount of quality content I had during this course. 

### Standards Aren't Only for Coding

Standards are applied to basically everything in our lives. There are standards for the way we speak, how people dress, the people we date, and most importantly, the way we code. Coding Standards pertain specifically towards code structure and syntax. Such coding standards were enforced within IntelliJ through the use of ESLint. However, there is no "ESLint" within the real world, but we can become it. Software Engineering has taught me that I should not rely on tools to enforce habits, but rather I should rely on myself. Sure, we had ESLint running throughout most of the course, but when I noticed that whenever it was not running correctly, I would automatically expect certain errors when they were not underlined in IntelliJ. Standards are something we should maintain and hold ourselves to always.
