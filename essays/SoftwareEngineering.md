"Software Engineering is just another class I need for my Bachelor's Degree" or so I thought. Just like any other student, I have been going through the motions in attempts to earn my degree.

### Standards Aren't Only for Coding

Standards are applied to basically everything in our lives. There are standards for the way we speak, how people dress, the people we date, and most importantly, the way we code. Coding Standards pertain specifically towards code structure and syntax. Such coding standards were enforced within IntelliJ through the use of ESLint. However, there is no "ESLint" within the real world, but we can become it. Software Engineering has taught me that I should not rely on tools to enforce habits, but rather I should rely on myself. Sure, we had ESLint running throughout most of the course, but when I noticed that whenever it was not running correctly, I would automatically expect certain errors when they were not underlined in IntelliJ. Standards are something we should maintain and hold ourselves to always.
